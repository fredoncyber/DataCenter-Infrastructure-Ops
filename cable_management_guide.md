# Cable Management Guide (Field)

- Use **90° paths** and avoid tight bends; respect fiber bend radius.
- Keep power and data paths separated where possible.
- Apply **velcro** every 6–8 inches; avoid over‑tightening.
- Label both ends using durable heat‑shrink or wrap labels.
- Maintain a **capacity buffer** in cable trays.
